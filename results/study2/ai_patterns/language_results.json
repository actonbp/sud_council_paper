  "emotional_analysis": "## Analysis of Emotional Language in SUD Counseling Career Discussions\n\nHere's a comparison of the emotional language used by the two groups discussing SUD counseling careers:\n\n**1. Emotional Words Used:**\n\n| Group | Emotional Words | Count | Examples |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **Interested** | pressure (4), love (2), passion, motivated, hopeful, support (2), great, better (2), improve, good, wrong, stopping, underrated, feasible, alternatives, interested | 21 | \"amount of emotional pressure,\" \"I love her,\" \"passion for helping people,\" \"hopeful,\" \"support me\" |\n| **Not Interested** | interesting (2), eager, positive (2), supportive, noble (2), demanding, great, easily, love | 12 | \"interesting field,\" \"positive emotions,\" \"supportive,\" \"noble cause,\" \"demanding\" |\n\n**Group 1 (Interested)** uses a wider range of emotion words, including both positive (love, passion, hopeful, support) and negative (pressure, wrong, stopping).  The repetition of \"pressure\" highlights a key concern.\n\n**Group 2 (Not Interested)** uses fewer emotion words overall, with a skew towards more neutral terms like \"interesting\" and \"supportive.\"  While positive words like \"noble\" and \"great\" appear, they are often qualified or lacking strong personal connection.\n\n\n**2. Positive vs. Negative Sentiment:**\n\n| Group | Positive Sentiment | Negative Sentiment |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Interested** | Expressed about the act of helping, personal connection with therapists, potential for positive change in clients. Examples: \"gotten better,\" \"helping people,\" \"I love her.\" | Focused on financial insecurity, workload, and emotional burden. Examples: \"doesn't pay enough,\" \"amount of emotional pressure,\" \"send them over the edge.\" |\n| **Not Interested** |  Acknowledged the positive aspects of the career (noble, helping). Examples: \"noble cause,\" \"positive emotions,\" \"helping people.\" |  Less direct negativity but more detachment and lack of enthusiasm. Examples: \"less responsible,\" \"doesn't seem like a bad job\" (weak positive). |\n\n**Group 1 (Interested)** expresses stronger emotions, both positive and negative.  Their positive sentiment is directly tied to the impact of therapy, while negative sentiments relate to personal and financial anxieties.\n\n**Group 2 (Not Interested)** expresses milder positive sentiment, often detached and general.  Their lack of strong negative sentiment might reflect disinterest rather than a truly positive outlook.\n\n**3. Confidence vs. Uncertainty Markers:**\n\n| Group | Confidence Markers | Uncertainty Markers |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Interested** | \"I wanted to be,\" \"I have a passion for it,\" \"she's very qualified,\" \"it's possible\" | \"I don't really know,\" \"I don't think it's going to work out,\" \"unless,\" \"I don't know if I'm going to be able to do it\" |\n| **Not Interested** | \"I know that,\" \"I think it's an interesting\" | \"I would not be too eager,\"  \"I don't really know,\" \"it honestly doesn't seem like a bad job\" (hedging), \"I guess\" (used multiple times) |\n\n**Group 1 (Interested)** shows a mix of confidence and uncertainty. They express desire and passion, but also significant doubt stemming from financial concerns.\n\n**Group 2 (Not Interested)** displays more uncertainty and less confidence.  Their language is hesitant, using qualifiers like \"I guess\" and hedging their statements.\n\n**4. Personal Emotional Investment Language:**\n\n| Group | Examples |\n|---|---|\n| **Interested** | \"My whole family...everyone has gotten better,\" \"I love her,\" \"my own therapist motivated me,\" \"I wanted to take her spot,\" \"my parents,\" \"my friends support me\" |\n| **Not Interested** | \"They'd be all for it,\"  \"frequent visits to dentists,\" \"fell in love with...dentistry\" (different field), \"for me personally\" (focused on self rather than client impact)  |\n\n**Group 1 (Interested)** uses highly personal language, referencing family experiences, relationships with therapists, and the emotional influence of others. This reveals a deeper emotional connection to the field.\n\n**Group 2 (Not Interested)**  lacks the same level of personal emotional investment towards counseling. Their examples are either general (\"They'd be all for it\") or relate to other career paths, demonstrating a lack of personal connection with the specific topic of SUD counseling.\n\n\nIn summary, Group 1 (Interested) exhibits a greater range and intensity of emotions, both positive and negative, intertwined with personal experiences and anxieties. Group 2 (Not Interested) displays less emotional engagement with the topic, using more neutral language and expressing more uncertainty.  This analysis highlights the significant role of emotional factors in career decision-making.\n",
  "phrase_patterns": "**INTERESTED GROUP PHRASES:**\n\n1. \"I don't think\" - 7 times (I don't think it's going to work out)\n2. \"I don't know\" - 6 times (I don't know if I'm going to be able to do it)\n3. \"I want to\" - 5 times (I want to do nursing)\n4. \"help people\" - 4 times (I am interested in, like, helping people)\n5. \"I think it's\" - 4 times (I think it's really important)\n6. \"a lot of\" - 4 times (It takes a lot of years)\n7. \"like a\" - 4 times (Like a family)\n8. \"mental health\" - 3 times (people who have mental health things)\n9. \"they would be\" - 3 times (they would be supportive)\n10. \"make a lot of money\" - 3 times (they don't make a lot of money)\n\n\n\n**NOT INTERESTED GROUP PHRASES:**\n\n1. \"I think it's\" - 6 times (I think it's an interesting job)\n2. \"I don't think\" - 4 times (I don't think it's a good idea)\n3. \"I would say\" - 4 times (I would say financials)\n4. \"I feel like\" - 4 times (I feel like it's a lot smaller)\n5. \"I want to\" - 3 times (I want to be an ER doctor)\n6. \"a lot of\" - 3 times (a lot of school and years coming)\n7. \"I don't know\" - 3 times (I don't know much of that area)\n8. \"would be like\" - 3 times (would be like, okay)\n9. \"like a\" - 3 times (like a similar path) \n10. \"mental health\" - 3 times (battling with mental health)\n\n\n\nIt's important to note that some phrases, like \"I don't think,\" \"I want to,\" \"a lot of,\" \"like a,\" \"I don't know,\" and \"mental health\" appear frequently in *both* groups. While they meet the criteria of appearing at least 3 times within a group, they are not as distinctive between the groups as other phrases on the list.  I've included them for thoroughness, but the real differentiation comes from the other phrases that are more unique to each group.  For instance, \"make a lot of money\" is very specific to the Interested Group's concerns about the profession.\n"
