INTERPRETATION:
These patterns represent the most reliable findings from our AI-assisted analysis.
They combine demographic characteristics with language use to predict interest
in SUD counseling careers with reasonable accuracy given our small sample size.

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. Treatment experience (MH or family SU) combined with helping language strongly
   predicts interest
2. Language patterns alone can be moderately predictive
3. Demographic factors interact with expressed concerns in meaningful ways
4. Some patterns apply to many participants (high coverage) while others are
   more specific but highly accurate

LIMITATIONS:
- Small sample size (N=40) limits generalizability
- Cross-validation shows some variability in pattern performance
- Patterns should be validated in larger, independent samples
