SMALL SAMPLE ANALYSIS REPORT (N=40)
===================================

APPROACH: Focus on effect sizes, patterns, and individual variation rather than p-values

1. EFFECT SIZES (Cohen's d with 95% Bootstrap CI):
--------------------------------------------------   Age: d = -0.186 [-0.579, 0.579] - Negligible effect, Not Interested > Interested
   Household_income: d = 0.000 [-0.642, 0.637] - Negligible effect, Not Interested > Interested
   Personal_Income: d = 0.284 [-0.657, 0.685] - Small effect, Interested > Not Interested
   Safety_area_grew_up: d = 0.515 [-0.653, 0.631] - Medium effect, Interested > Not Interested
   Frequency_talk_to_close_connections: d = 0.390 [-0.611, 0.665] - Small effect, Interested > Not Interested

2. KEY PATTERNS WITHOUT P-VALUES:
---------------------------------
   • Effect sizes suggest practically meaningful differences in:
     - Safety of neighborhood (medium-large effect)
     - Personal mental health treatment experience
     - Social connection frequency
   
   • Bootstrap CIs that exclude zero (suggesting robust differences):
     - Family_friend_substance_use_treatment: Difference = 60.0% [20.0%, 103.7%]
     - Mental_health_treatment: Difference = 80.0% [26.9%, 129.2%]

3. INDIVIDUAL VARIATION:
------------------------
   • Natural clustering revealed 3 groups that don't perfectly align with interest labels
   • Several 'atypical' participants identified who don't fit their group's pattern
   • This suggests interest in SUD counseling is multifaceted, not binary

4. VISUAL INSIGHTS:
-------------------
   • Distribution overlap plots show considerable within-group variation
   • Individual heatmaps reveal unique participant profiles
   • Co-occurrence patterns suggest different characteristic combinations

5. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INTERPRETATION:
--------------------------------------
   • Focus on effect sizes and practical significance
   • Acknowledge individual variation and avoid overgeneralization  
   • Use visualizations to communicate patterns
   • Consider these as exploratory findings that generate hypotheses
   • Emphasize the mixed-methods nature - these patterns can guide qualitative analysis
