üìã **CLUSTER PREVALENCE RANKING:**
1. **Cluster 4** - 18.8% of SUD discourse (most prominent theme)
2. **Cluster 3** - 11.9% of SUD discourse  
3. **Clusters 1 & 2** - 4.4% each (tied, smaller but distinct themes)

üìù **RESEARCH TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. **Review each cluster's word groupings** - These emerged from mathematical co-occurrence analysis
2. **Assign meaningful theme names** - Based on conceptual coherence of word groups
3. **Consider prevalence** - Cluster 4 represents the most prominent thematic framework
4. **Document rationale** - Explain how word groupings support chosen theme names
5. **Cross-validate themes** - Do the emergent clusters align with theoretical frameworks?
