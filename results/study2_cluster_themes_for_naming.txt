üìä **CLUSTER 3 - SUBSTANCE/PERSONAL FRAME** (304 mentions, 17.2% of SUD discourse)
**Core Words:**
- substance (45 mentions) - direct SUD terminology
- mental (41 mentions) - mental health context

üìã **CLUSTER PREVALENCE RANKING:**
1. **Cluster 3** - 17.2% of SUD discourse (most prominent theme)
2. **Cluster 4** - 14.6% of SUD discourse  
3. **Clusters 1 & 2** - 4.7% each (tied, smaller but distinct themes)

---

üìù **RESEARCH TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. **Review each cluster's word groupings** - These emerged from mathematical co-occurrence analysis
2. **Assign meaningful theme names** - Based on conceptual coherence of word groups
3. **Consider prevalence** - Cluster 3 represents the most prominent thematic framework
4. **Document rationale** - Explain how word groupings support chosen theme names
5. **Cross-validate themes** - Do the emergent clusters align with theoretical frameworks?

ANALYSIS NOTES:

Total Coverage: 41.2% of all SUD discourse (767 mentions out of 1,766 total)

Key Improvements from Previous Analysis:
‚úì Removed problematic function words ("dont", "lot")
‚úì More semantically meaningful clusters
‚úì Clear thematic coherence within clusters
‚úì Better separation of conceptual frameworks

Strongest Co-occurrence Patterns:
- feel + people (24 co-occurrences)
- health + mental (22 co-occurrences)  
- abuse + substance (22 co-occurrences)
- person + people (19 co-occurrences)
- help + people (18 co-occurrences)

Instructions for Researchers:
1. Review the words in each cluster
2. Consider the co-occurrence patterns
3. Choose or create appropriate theme names
4. Consider how themes relate to SUD counseling career interests
5. Document rationale for theme naming decisions
