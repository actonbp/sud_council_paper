STUDY 2 FINAL METHODOLOGY RECOMMENDATION

üîç VALIDATION FINDINGS:
Current approach detects 109 utterances (35.2%) as SUD-related
BUT analysis reveals many are general mental health discussions

BREAKDOWN OF 109 DETECTED UTTERANCES:
- Professional Only (42 = 38.5%): "therapist", "counselor" without substance context
- Substance Only (39 = 35.8%): Clear substance terms like "substanc abus"  
- Substance + Professional (18 = 16.5%): Both substance AND professional terms
- Other categories (10 = 9.2%): Treatment/other contexts

EXAMPLES OF PROBLEMATIC "PROFESSIONAL ONLY" DETECTION:
1. "psychologist psychologist relat overlap...mental health" (general psychology)
2. "therapist emphas social psychiatrist realm psycholog" (general mental health)
3. "mom clinic social worker" (clinical social work, not SUD)

EXAMPLE OF VALID SUD DETECTION:
5. "substanc abus counselor...meet substanc abus counselor talk substanc" (clear SUD focus)

üí° RECOMMENDED CONSERVATIVE APPROACH:
INCLUDE only utterances with substance-specific terms:
- Substance Only: 39 utterances
- Substance + Professional: 18 utterances  
- Substance + Treatment: 2 utterances
TOTAL: 59 utterances (19.0% vs current 35.2%)

üìä IMPACT:
- Reduces false positives by 50 utterances (45.9% reduction)
- Eliminates general mental health discussions
- Maintains clear SUD-specific focus
- More defensible for publication

üéØ CO-AUTHOR DECISION:
Recommend using conservative approach (59 utterances, 19.0%) for main analysis
Keep broader approach (109 utterances, 35.2%) for sensitivity analysis
