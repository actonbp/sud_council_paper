# SUD Counseling Career Research Project

## Project Overview
This is a **completed mixed-methods academic research study** examining factors influencing undergraduate interest in SUD (Substance Use Disorder) counseling careers. The project consists of:

- **Study 1**: Quantitative analysis using R tidymodels (L1-regularized logistic regression)
- **Study 2**: Qualitative text analysis of focus group discussions using tidytext
- **Publication**: APA-formatted Quarto manuscript ready for journal submission

## Key Project Context

### Primary Author & Collaborator Information
- **Erika** is the **first author** and primary researcher
- This repository is set up for collaborative academic work
- The project is **publication-ready** and **complete**

### Critical Analysis Results
- **Study 1 Performance**: Cross-validation ROC AUC = 0.787 [95% CI: 0.766, 0.809]
- **Key Finding**: Students "uncertain" about mental health careers show 74% higher odds of SUD counseling interest
- **Study 2 Themes**: 4 data-driven themes from conservative text analysis (19.7% detection rate)

## File Structure & Workflow

### Essential Files for Erika
- `sud_council_paper.qmd` - **Main manuscript** (primary editing target)
- `scripts/r/study1_main_analysis.R` - Complete tidymodels analysis
- `scripts/r/study2_*.R` - Text analysis pipeline (4 scripts)
- `results/` - All analysis outputs and visualizations
- `references.bib` - Bibliography in BibTeX format

### Compilation Instructions
**CRITICAL**: Always use APA extension for proper formatting:
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT (APA formatting)
quarto render sud_council_paper.qmd --to apaquarto-docx

# ❌ WRONG (breaks APA styling)
quarto render sud_council_paper.qmd --to docx
```

## Analysis Guidelines

### Study 1 (Quantitative)
- Uses **modern tidymodels framework** with 2025 best practices
- Implements L1-regularized logistic regression with feature selection
- Includes comprehensive validation (bootstrap, cross-validation)
- Results are **statistically robust** and **publication-ready**

### Study 2 (Qualitative)
- Conservative SUD detection approach (substance-specific terminology required)
- Porter stemming via SnowballC for linguistic robustness
- Co-occurrence analysis for data-driven theme emergence
- **Precision over recall** methodology to ensure SUD-specific focus

## Academic Standards

### Statistical Reporting
- Report confidence intervals for all effect sizes
- Include sample sizes for each analysis group
- Only report findings with p < 0.05 AND adequate N (≥20)
- Conservative approach adopted throughout

### APA Formatting Requirements
- Tables moved to end with "INSERT TABLE X ABOUT HERE" placeholders
- APA 7th edition citations and references
- Times New Roman, double spacing, proper margins
- Running head and page numbers

## Repository Maintenance

### Data Privacy
- **NEVER commit data files** - .gitignore excludes sensitive information
- Analysis outputs (results/) are safe to include
- Focus group transcripts contain participant information

### Archive System
- `archive/` folder preserves all previous work
- Clear documentation of what was moved and why
- Maintains project history without cluttering main workspace

## Collaboration Workflow

### When Making Changes
1. **Read project status first**: Check CLAUDE.md for current state
2. **Follow existing patterns**: Maintain tidymodels/tidytext methodology
3. **Update documentation**: Ensure changes are reflected in README.md
4. **Test compilation**: Verify Quarto renders properly with APA formatting

### Before Committing
- Ensure manuscript compiles successfully
- Run relevant analysis scripts to verify reproducibility
- Update version info in CLAUDE.md if major changes made

## Research Impact
This study provides **actionable insights for SUD counselor recruitment**:
- Target students exploring (not committed to) mental health careers
- Increase profession visibility and familiarity
- Focus recruitment efforts on junior-year students
- Address specific demographic patterns identified in analysis
