# Repository Cleanup Summary - June 29, 2025

## What We Did

### 1. Created Clean Manuscript Structure
- Moved all manuscript files to `manuscript/` folder:
  - `sud_council_paper.qmd` (main document)
  - `sud_council_paper.docx` (compiled output)
  - `references.bib` (bibliography)
  - `_extensions/wjschne/apaquarto/` (APA formatting)

### 2. Archived All Study 2 Work
- Moved all Study 2 scripts to `archive/2025-06-29/`
- Archived all Study 2 results and outputs
- Created empty `scripts/r/study2/` folder with placeholder for fresh tidytext implementation

### 3. Simplified Repository Structure
- Archived meetings folder
- Archived config folder
- Kept only 2 cursor rules (data-privacy.mdc, sud-research-project.mdc)
- Removed all build artifacts

### 4. Cleaned Data Directory
- Kept only essential Study 1 data:
  - `data/survey/ml_ready_survey_data.csv`
  - `data/survey/survey_raw.csv`
- Archived all focus group data (Study 2)
- Archived all processed data folders

### 5. Updated Documentation
- Updated README.md with new paths
- Simplified Study 2 section to note redesign in progress
- Updated compilation commands to use `manuscript/` folder

## Final Clean Structure

```

  ├── study1/            # Complete Study 1 analysis
  └── study2/            # Empty, ready for new work
results/r/
  └── study1_logistic_fs_modern/  # Study 1 results only
data/survey/             # Study 1 data only
.cursor/rules/           # Minimal rules
README.md
CLAUDE.md
archive/2025-06-29/      # Everything else preserved
```

## Key Commands Updated

Compile manuscript:
```bash
quarto render manuscript/sud_council_paper.qmd --to apaquarto-docx
```

## Next Steps

1. Study 1 is complete and working
2. Study 2 can now be rebuilt from scratch with tidytext
3. Repository is clean and easy to navigate
4. All historical work is preserved in archive
