# Data Privacy and Security Standards

## CRITICAL: Participant Data Protection

### Never Commit These Files
- `data/` directory contents (contains participant information)
- `*.csv` files with raw survey or focus group data
- Any files containing personal identifiers
- Backup files with participant data (`*.bak`, `~$*.docx`)

### Safe to Include
- `results/` directory (aggregated, non-identifiable outputs)
- Analysis scripts without embedded data
- Figures and visualizations (no personal information)
- Model coefficients and statistical summaries

## .gitignore Compliance

### Data File Exclusions
```
# CRITICAL - Raw data protection
data/
*.csv
!**/example_*.csv
!**/config_*.csv

# Excel files that might contain data
*.xlsx
*.xls

# Statistical software files
*.sav
*.dta
*.rda
*.rds
*.RData
```

### Verification Steps
1. Check `.gitignore` includes all data patterns
2. Use `git status` to verify no data files are staged
3. Review `data/` directory is properly excluded
4. Confirm focus group transcripts not tracked

## Repository Handoff Protocol

### Before Sharing Repository
- [ ] Verify no data files in git history
- [ ] Check .gitignore excludes sensitive directories
- [ ] Ensure analysis outputs contain no personal identifiers
- [ ] Confirm participant consent covers data sharing approach

### Collaborative Workflow
- Share data files through secure, separate channels
- Use consistent file naming for local data directories
- Document data structure without including actual data
- Maintain participant anonymity in all communications

## IRB and Ethics Compliance

### Data Handling Requirements
- Focus group participants provided informed consent
- Data used only for approved research purposes  
- No re-identification attempts of anonymized data
- Secure storage of original transcripts (not in repository)

### Documentation Standards
- Maintain data dictionary without personal identifiers
- Document anonymization procedures in methodology
- Include participant demographic summaries (not individual data)
- Follow institutional data retention policies

## Emergency Procedures

### If Data Accidentally Committed
1. **STOP** - Do not push to remote repository
2. Remove files from staging: `git reset HEAD <file>`
3. Add to .gitignore immediately
4. Use `git filter-branch` if already committed locally
5. Notify research team and IRB if data was exposed

### Repository Monitoring
- Regular .gitignore compliance checks
- Automated CI checks for data file patterns (if configured)
- Periodic review of git history for accidental inclusions
- Team training on secure repository practices

## Analysis Output Guidelines

### Safe Result Types
- Statistical summaries (means, correlations, confidence intervals)
- Model coefficients and performance metrics
- Aggregated demographic breakdowns (n â‰¥ 20 per group)
- Visualizations without individual data points

### Restricted Content
- Individual survey responses or focus group quotes with identifiers
- Cell sizes < 5 in demographic breakdowns
- Raw transcripts or unprocessed text data
- Any output that could enable re-identification
