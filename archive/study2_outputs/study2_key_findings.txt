STUDY 2 METHODOLOGY VALIDATION - KEY FINDINGS

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
Current SUD detection approach is TOO BROAD
- 42 utterances (38.5%) detected by "Professional Only" terms
- Examples: general psychology, trauma therapy, clinical social work
- These are NOT SUD-specific discussions

ðŸ“Š DETECTION BREAKDOWN:
- Professional Only: 42 utterances (38.5%) - QUESTIONABLE
- Substance Only: 39 utterances (35.8%) - VALID
- Substance + Professional: 18 utterances (16.5%) - VALID
- Other: 4 utterances (3.7%) - REVIEW
- Treatment Only: 4 utterances (3.7%) - QUESTIONABLE  
- Substance + Treatment: 2 utterances (1.8%) - VALID

ðŸ’¡ RECOMMENDED CONSERVATIVE APPROACH:
REQUIRE substance-specific terms (addiction, substance, alcohol, drug, abuse, etc.)
- Conservative count: ~61 utterances (~19.7% vs current 35.2%)
- Eliminates general mental health false positives
- Ensures SUD-specific focus

ðŸ“‹ METHODOLOGY DOCUMENTATION CREATED:
- study2_detection_analysis.csv (detection logic validation)
- study2_preprocessing_pipeline.csv (methodology steps)
- study2_sud_terms_complete.csv (all 53 terms used)
- study2_conservative_approach.csv (recommended detection)

ðŸŽ¯ CO-AUTHOR DECISION NEEDED:
1. Use conservative approach (substance-required)?
2. Accept broader approach with disclaimers?
3. Hybrid approach with both analyses?
