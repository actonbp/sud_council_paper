ðŸ“Š METHODOLOGY NOTES:
âœ“ Clusters emerged from mathematical analysis of word co-occurrence patterns
âœ“ Used Ward's hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance  
âœ“ Cut dendrogram at k=4 for optimal theme separation
âœ“ Theme NAMES come from researcher interpretation of word groupings
âœ“ Theme GROUPINGS come from data-driven clustering

NEXT STEPS:
1. Research team reviews clusters independently
2. Proposes theme names based on word groupings
3. Discusses and reconciles different interpretations  
4. Documents final theme names and rationales
5. Updates manuscript with researcher-assigned theme names
