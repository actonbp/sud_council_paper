ADVANCED STUDY 2 VISUALIZATION METHODOLOGY
=========================================

FIGURE 1: Enhanced Thematic Frequency Chart
- Data: 61 conservative SUD utterances (19.7% detection rate)
- Processing: Porter stemming, ≥3 frequency threshold
- Visualization: ggplot2 with academic theming
- Color palette: ColorBrewer academic standards
- Output: 300 DPI PNG + vector PDF

FIGURE 2: Co-occurrence Network Analysis
- Nodes: Top 14 most frequent terms
- Edges: 83 co-occurrence relationships (≥2 joint appearances)
- Layout: Force-directed algorithm with thematic clustering
- Network metrics: Undirected, weighted by co-occurrence strength
- Visualization: Custom network layout with ggplot2

APA COMPLIANCE:
- Figure notes include sample sizes, methodology, and data sources
- Conservative language regarding causation and generalization
- Proper statistical reporting (percentages, frequencies, thresholds)
- Publication-ready resolution and formatting
- Colorblind-accessible palette

THEMATIC VALIDATION:
- Data-driven theme emergence through co-occurrence analysis
- Cross-session consistency verified
- Conservative detection reduces false positives
- Porter stemming handles linguistic variation
- Network structure validates thematic coherence
