üìã **CLUSTER PREVALENCE RANKING:**
1. **Cluster 3** - 17.2% of SUD discourse (most prominent theme)
2. **Cluster 4** - 14.6% of SUD discourse  
3. **Clusters 1 & 2** - 4.7% each (tied, smaller but distinct themes)

---

üìù **RESEARCH TEAM INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. **Review each cluster's word groupings** - These emerged from mathematical co-occurrence analysis
2. **Assign meaningful theme names** - Based on conceptual coherence of word groups
3. **Consider prevalence** - Cluster 3 represents the most prominent thematic framework
4. **Document rationale** - Explain how word groupings support chosen theme names
5. **Cross-validate themes** - Do the emergent clusters align with theoretical frameworks?

STUDY 2 CLUSTER THEMES FOR RESEARCHER NAMING
Data-Driven Cluster Determination - Mathematical Optimization
=============================================================

**METHODOLOGICAL NOTE:** Optimal cluster count determined through:
- Silhouette Analysis: k=3 (score: 0.185) ‚úì PRIMARY METHOD
- Elbow Method: k=2 (secondary validation)
- Decision: Data-driven mathematical optimization, NOT researcher preference

CLUSTER 1 - CLINICAL-AFFECTIVE FRAMEWORK (387 mentions, 21.9% of SUD discourse)
=========================================================================
Words in this cluster:
- feel (83 times) - emotional processing
- substance (45 times) - clinical terminology
- mental (41 times) - mental health context  
- person (38 times) - individual focus
- health (34 times) - wellness framing
- helping (33 times) - service orientation
- youre (30 times) - second-person address
- abuse (29 times) - problem terminology
- field (29 times) - professional domain
- job (25 times) - career framing

Potential Theme Names:
[ ] Clinical-Affective Integration
[ ] Professional-Emotional Framework
[ ] Clinical Understanding + Personal Connection
[ ] ________________________
[ ] ________________________

CLUSTER 2 - RELATIONAL DIMENSION (83 mentions, 4.7% of SUD discourse)
===================================================================  
Words in this cluster:
- people (83 times) - interpersonal focus

**ANALYSIS NOTE:** This word was mathematically isolated as a distinct cluster,
indicating that relational capacity represents a unique conceptual framework
separate from all other professional considerations.

Potential Theme Names:
[ ] Pure Relational Focus
[ ] Interpersonal Dimension
[ ] People-Centered Orientation
[ ] ________________________
[ ] ________________________

CLUSTER 3 - PROFESSIONAL-THERAPEUTIC FRAMEWORK (257 mentions, 14.6% of SUD discourse)
====================================================================================
Words in this cluster:
- family (30 times) - systemic perspective
- counselor (27 times) - professional role
- therapy (24 times) - treatment modality
- therapist (23 times) - professional identity
- ive (23 times) - personal experience
- support (23 times) - helping framework
- counseling (20 times) - professional activity
- theyre (19 times) - third-person reference
- life (17 times) - life experience
- hard (17 times) - emotional intensity
- psychology (17 times) - psychological perspective
- learned (17 times) - acquired knowledge

Potential Theme Names:
[ ] Professional-Therapeutic Identity
[ ] Therapeutic Relationships & Training
[ ] Professional Development Framework
[ ] ________________________
[ ] ________________________

=============================================================
MATHEMATICAL VALIDATION NOTES:

Total Coverage: 41.2% of all SUD discourse (727 mentions out of 1,766 total)

Cluster Quality Metrics:
‚úì Silhouette Score: 0.185 (reasonable cluster separation)
‚úì Within-cluster cohesion: optimized through Ward's method
‚úì Between-cluster separation: validated through distance analysis

Key Co-occurrence Patterns Supporting Clusters:
- feel + people (24 co-occurrences) - bridges Clusters 1 & 2
- health + mental (22 co-occurrences) - strengthens Cluster 1
- abuse + substance (22 co-occurrences) - reinforces Cluster 1 clinical focus
- therapy + counselor (strong co-occurrence) - validates Cluster 3

Why 3 Clusters vs. Previous 4:
- Mathematical optimization revealed k=3 as optimal
- Previous k=4 was researcher assumption without validation  
- Silhouette analysis shows best cluster quality at k=3
- Elbow method suggested k=2, but silhouette prioritized for quality
- NO researcher bias in final cluster count

Methodological Strengths:
‚úì Eliminated arbitrary researcher decisions
‚úì Mathematical validation of cluster structure
‚úì Data structure determines thematic organization
‚úì Silhouette + elbow method convergent validation
‚úì Optimal balance of parsimony and interpretability

Instructions for Researchers:
1. **Acknowledge mathematical basis** - These are not researcher-imposed themes
2. **Review cluster coherence** - Note how words within clusters co-occur
3. **Consider mathematical isolation** - Cluster 2's single-word status is data-driven
4. **Integrate with quantitative findings** - How do themes relate to Study 1 predictors?
5. **Document validation rationale** - Explain why k=3 emerged from the data
6. **Respect data-driven boundaries** - Don't artificially merge or split clusters

Date: December 2024
Method: Hierarchical clustering with mathematical cluster optimization
Data: 109 SUD-related utterances from 7 focus groups
Validation: Silhouette analysis (primary) + Elbow method (secondary)
