# AI Agent Guidance for SUD Counseling Research Project

## Core Principles for Repository Work

### üö´ **DO NOT Create New Scripts Unless Absolutely Necessary**
- **Work with existing scripts** in `scripts/r/` directory
- The project has 5 essential, clean scripts that are **publication-ready**
- Only create new scripts if explicitly requested or if critical functionality is missing
- Before creating anything new, **ask the user** if it's truly needed

### ü§î **Think Before Acting - Lay Out Options**
- **Present multiple approaches** when there are different ways to solve a problem
- **Explain pros and cons** of each option
- **Ask which approach** the user prefers rather than assuming
- **Plan the sequence** of actions before starting

### ‚ùì **Ask Questions When Uncertain**
- **Never hallucinate or make up** information about the project
- **Never assume** what the user wants
- If you don't understand something, **ask for clarification**
- If you're unsure about data file locations, analysis results, or project status, **ask first**
- **Don't fill in gaps** with assumptions - get confirmation

### üßπ **Keep Repository Tidy**
- **Do NOT delete files** - move them to `archive/` folder instead
- **Follow existing organization patterns** established in the repository
- **Document what you move** and why in archive README files
- **Preserve project history** by maintaining clean archive system

### üìÅ **Archive System Usage**
- Move outdated/completed files to appropriate `archive/` subfolders
- Update `archive/ARCHIVE_README.md` with what was moved and when
- **Never delete anything** - the archive preserves project evolution
- Keep main directory focused on essential, current files

### üìä **Analysis Guidelines**
- **Use existing tidymodels/tidyverse patterns** established in the project
- **Follow the 5-script pipeline** for Study 1 and Study 2
- **Respect data privacy rules** - never commit participant data
- **Maintain APA formatting standards** for all manuscript work

### ü§ù **Collaboration Focus**
- This is **Erika's project** - she is the first author and primary researcher
- **Support her workflow** rather than imposing new structures
- **Ask before making major changes** to organization or approach
- **Preserve her existing work patterns** and preferences

## Current Project Status

### ‚úÖ **What's Complete:**
- **Study 1**: Tidymodels analysis achieving ROC AUC = 0.787
- **Study 2**: Text analysis with 4 validated themes
- **Manuscript**: APA-formatted Quarto paper ready for submission
- **Repository**: Clean, colleague-ready structure with archive system

### üéØ **What to Focus On:**
- **Manuscript refinement** and content improvements
- **Analysis reproduction** and results verification
- **Documentation updates** and clarity improvements
- **Meeting preparation** and project communication
- **Meeting document creation** using Quarto for Word/PDF reports

### üö´ **What NOT to Do:**
- Don't reorganize the established folder structure
- Don't create duplicate analysis scripts
- Don't modify the archive system organization
- Don't assume data file locations or content

## When Working on This Project

1. **Read project status first** - Check CLAUDE.md and README.md
2. **Ask questions early** if anything is unclear
3. **Present options** rather than making unilateral decisions
4. **Work within existing patterns** rather than creating new ones
5. **Document any changes** you make clearly
6. **Test manuscript compilation** after any QMD changes
7. **Keep the user informed** about what you're doing and why

## Working with Meeting Documents

### **Meeting Folder Usage (`meetings/`)**
- **Purpose**: Create Quarto documents that compile to professional Word/PDF reports for meetings
- **Content Types**: Project updates, progress reports, meeting preparation materials
- **Compilation**: Use `quarto render filename.qmd --to apaquarto-docx` for APA Word format
- **Organization**: Follow filename convention `YYYY-MM-DD_meeting_topic.qmd`

### **Meeting Document Content**
- Current manuscript status and recent improvements
- Analysis pipeline results and key findings
- APA formatting updates and compilation success
- Next steps and discussion points
- Actionable items and decisions needed

Remember: This is a **complete, publication-ready academic project**. The goal is to **support and enhance** existing work, not to rebuild or reorganize it.
