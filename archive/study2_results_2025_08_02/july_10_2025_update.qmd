# Study 1 Results Summary

We completed Study 1 with N=391 undergraduate students using machine learning (L1-regularized logistic regression) to predict interest in SUD counseling careers. The model achieved strong performance (ROC AUC = 0.787).

## Key Findings

**1. Career Uncertainty is the Strongest Predictor**
- Students committed to mental health careers rarely consider SUD counseling (only 8.5% interested)
- Students uncertain about mental health careers show much higher interest (33.3%)
- Students with no mental health career plans show highest interest (64.0%)
- This suggests SUD counseling attracts career explorers, not mental health specialists

**2. Professional Exposure Matters**
- Clear dose-response relationship:
  - No familiarity with SUD counselors: 27.6% interested
  - Some familiarity: 38.6% interested
  - More familiarity: 56.1% interested

**3. Timing Matters**
- First-year students: 40.3% interested
- Second-year students: 33.5% interested
- Interest appears to decline in later years (though smaller samples limit conclusions)

**What Wasn't Significant**: Religion/spirituality and race/ethnicity showed no statistically significant effects despite initial appearances.

# Study 2 Analysis Plan

Study 2 uses focus group data from 19 participants across 7 sessions. Given the small sample size, we're taking a different approach than originally planned.

## New Approach: Person-Level Classification

Instead of classifying individual utterances, we'll use Google Gemini to read ALL of each person's comments throughout the focus group and make a holistic judgment about their interest level.

**Why This Makes Sense:**
- We care about whether the PERSON is interested, not individual statements
- People express mixed feelings - the LLM can weigh these naturally
- Someone might show interest through questions without directly stating "I'm interested"
- The full context provides a more accurate picture

## Implementation Steps

1. **Organize transcripts by person** - compile all utterances from each participant
2. **Use Gemini for person-level classification**:
   - INTERESTED: Shows genuine interest in SUD counseling career
   - NOT_INTERESTED: Expresses disinterest or preference for other paths
   - NEUTRAL/UNCLEAR: Cannot determine clear interest level
3. **Extract supporting quotes** - have Gemini identify key utterances that support its classification
4. **Analyze language patterns** between interested vs not-interested groups
5. **Link to demographics** - examine if survey responses correlate with interest

## Analysis Focus

With only 19 people, we'll focus on:
- **Descriptive patterns** rather than statistical prediction
- **Rich examples** of how students express interest or disinterest
- **Themes** that validate or extend Study 1 findings
- **Practical insights** for recruitment messaging

## Linking to Qualtrics Survey Data

**Important**: A subset of focus group participants also completed a separate Qualtrics survey with additional questions about:
- Demographics (age, year, major, etc.)
- Career interests and plans
- Personal experiences with mental health/substance use
- Attitudes toward counseling professions

We will link each person's focus group classification (INTERESTED/NOT_INTERESTED/NEUTRAL) to their survey responses to explore:
- Whether demographic factors relate to interest patterns
- How survey responses align with expressed interest in focus groups
- Additional context about participants' backgrounds and experiences

All analyses will be descriptive given the small sample size, focusing on patterns and examples rather than statistical significance.

## Timeline

Results should be ready for the next team meeting.

## Expected Outcomes

This approach will tell us:
- How many focus group participants showed interest (base rate)
- What language distinguishes interested from not-interested students
- Whether themes align with Study 1's career uncertainty finding
- Specific barriers and attractions in students' own words

The combination of Study 1 (what predicts interest) and Study 2 (how interest is expressed) will provide actionable insights for SUD counseling recruitment efforts.
