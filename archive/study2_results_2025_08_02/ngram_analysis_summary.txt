📝 RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS:

1. **Conceptual Richness**: N-grams capture complex concepts that single words miss
2. **Semantic Precision**: Multi-word terms provide specific rather than generic meanings
3. **Context Preservation**: Phrases maintain relational and temporal context
4. **Professional Language**: Captures field-specific terminology naturally
5. **Decision Processes**: Reveals thinking patterns through phrase combinations

🎉 RECOMMENDATION: 
The n-gram approach successfully captures the complexity of student discourse about 
SUD counseling careers. While k=2 provides broad themes, the rich phrase content 
within each theme offers substantial analytical depth for your research paper.

Consider using both the 3-theme single-word analysis for broad categorization AND 
the n-gram analysis for detailed phrase-level insights!
