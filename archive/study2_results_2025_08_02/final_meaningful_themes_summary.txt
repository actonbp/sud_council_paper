✅ Eliminated meaningless artifacts (ve, don, re, ll, etc.)
✅ Focused on substantive terms (6+ characters on average)
✅ Detected meaningful phrases (mental_health, helping_people)
✅ Optimal k=3 provides clear thematic separation
✅ Balanced document distribution across themes

QUALITY VALIDATION:
• Term meaningfulness: 6.0 avg characters (excellent vs 3-4 before)
• Topic diversity: 73.3% (good separation between themes)
• Coherence: 0.255 (moderate semantic coherence)
• Balance: 95.6% (very even distribution)
