🔍 KEY INSIGHTS FROM DOMAIN FILTERING:

✅ WHAT WE LEARNED BY REMOVING OBVIOUS TERMS:
• Students aren't just saying "I want to do counseling" - they're expressing deeper motivations
• Two distinct pathways: practical career considerations vs. altruistic helping drive
• Family and personal background influences helping motivation
• Career stability and professional growth drive practical considerations
• Both groups see value in the work, but for different underlying reasons

✅ MEANINGFUL PHRASES DISCOVERED (after filtering):
• "helping_people" - Core service motivation
• "little_bit" - Cautious, measured approach to career decisions
• "parents_friends" - Social network influence
• "working_kids" - Specific population interest
• "every_day" - Daily work reality consideration
• "big_responsibility" - Recognition of professional weight

✅ RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS:
1. **Dual Pathways**: Students approach SUD counseling careers through two distinct motivational pathways
2. **Career vs. Calling**: Some see it as a practical career choice, others as a calling to help
3. **Family Influence**: Personal/family experiences strongly influence helping motivation
4. **Practical Awareness**: Even altruistically-motivated students consider practical aspects
5. **Professional Recognition**: Students understand the responsibility and importance of the work

✅ "job work field" - Career practicality focus
✅ "parents family" - Personal influence factors
✅ "important pretty" - Value and assessment language

🎉 FINAL RECOMMENDATION:

This domain-filtered analysis successfully reveals the TWO CORE UNDERLYING MOTIVATIONS 
that drive student interest in SUD counseling careers:

1. **PRACTICAL CAREER PATHWAY** (49%) - Students attracted by stable, meaningful work opportunities
2. **ALTRUISTIC SERVICE CALLING** (51%) - Students driven by desire to help others and make a difference

These findings provide much deeper insight than surface-level field preferences, 
revealing the fundamental psychological and practical drivers behind career interest.
