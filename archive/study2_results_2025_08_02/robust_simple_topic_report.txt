ROBUST SIMPLE TOPIC MODELING - SUD COUNSELING RESEARCH
============================================================

METHODOLOGY - Bottom-Up Discovery:
• Strategic domain filtering (removed circular terms only)
• N-gram extraction using sklearn CountVectorizer
• Weighted TF-IDF (phrases get 2-3x weight)
• LDA topic modeling with 4 topics
• Robustness testing across 5 runs

ROBUSTNESS ASSESSMENT:
• Overall stability: 0.184 (POOR)
• Individual topic stability: ['0.256', '0.194', '0.122', '0.166']
