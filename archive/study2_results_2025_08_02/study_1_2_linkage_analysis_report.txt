KEY INSIGHT - NATURAL LINKAGE:
Study 1's quantitative finding that 'career uncertainty' predicts SUD counseling interest
is supported by Study 2's qualitative themes showing HOW uncertainty manifests:
• Educational uncertainty → exploring SUD as academic specialization
• Helping uncertainty → SUD as concrete way to make difference
• Family uncertainty → whether personal experience helps or hinders

This provides a complete narrative: uncertain students explore SUD counseling
as a pathway that addresses their specific motivational concerns.
