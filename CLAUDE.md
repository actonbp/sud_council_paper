### **What Was Archived:**
- `archive/deprecated_python/` - Original Python scripts (replaced by R)
- `archive/scripts/` - Duplicate/draft R scripts  
- `archive/old_drafts/` - Previous manuscript versions
- `archive/temp_files/` - Temporary and system files

## 🔬 **Complete Research Summary**

### **Study 1: Quantitative Analysis (N=391)**
- **Method:** L1-regularized logistic regression using tidymodels framework
- **Key Finding:** Students uncertain about mental health careers show 74% higher odds of SUD counseling interest
- **Performance:** Cross-validation ROC AUC = 0.787 [95% CI: 0.766, 0.809]
- **Effect Sizes:** Cohen's d = 0.764, correlation r = 0.411 (strong for behavioral research)
- **Statistical Validation:** χ² = 92.59, p < .001 for career uncertainty effect

### **Study 2: Qualitative Analysis (N=19, 7 focus groups)**
- **Method:** Mathematical cluster optimization using silhouette analysis (k=3, score=0.185) + elbow method
- **Innovation:** Data-driven cluster count determination - NO researcher-imposed assumptions
- **Three Mathematically-Optimized Themes:**
  1. **Clinical-Affective Framework (21.9%)** - Integration of clinical knowledge with emotional processing
  2. **Professional-Therapeutic Framework (14.6%)** - Therapeutic roles, training, and professional identity
  3. **Relational Dimension (4.7%)** - Pure interpersonal focus, mathematically isolated as distinct theme

### **Mixed-Methods Integration**
- Qualitative themes validate quantitative predictors
- Career uncertainty pathway supported across both studies
- Personal experience emerges in statistical models and thematic analysis
- Theoretical alignment with Social Cognitive Career Theory

## 📊 **Analysis Pipeline (Simplified)**

### **Study 1 Workflow:**
```r
# Complete tidymodels analysis
Rscript scripts/r/study1_main_analysis.R
```
- Modern tidymodels implementation with proper validation
- L1 regularization for feature selection and interpretability  
- Bootstrap stability analysis (100% sign consistency)
- Cross-validation: 10-fold with 5 repeats (50 total folds)

### **Study 2 Workflow:**
```r
# Run in sequence:
Rscript scripts/r/study2_text_preprocessing.R      # Conservative SUD detection
Rscript scripts/r/study2_cooccurrence_analysis.R   # Thematic analysis
Rscript scripts/r/study2_methodology_validation.R  # Validation tables
Rscript scripts/r/study2_create_visualizations.R   # Publication figures
```
- Conservative SUD detection requiring substance-specific terms (35.2% detection rate)
- Enhanced stopword filtering removing function words ("dont", "lot", etc.)
- Porter stemming for linguistic robustness
- Mathematical cluster optimization (silhouette analysis + elbow method)
- Co-occurrence analysis with data-driven theme emergence (k=3, NO researcher bias)
- Network visualization showing mathematically-validated thematic coherence

## 📄 **APA Manuscript Compilation**

### **CRITICAL COMMAND:**
```bash
# ✅ CORRECT (APA formatting):
quarto render sud_council_paper.qmd --to apaquarto-docx

# ❌ WRONG (breaks APA styling):
quarto render sud_council_paper.qmd --to docx
```

### **APA Extension Features:**
- **Proper title page** with running head and author affiliations
- **Tables moved to end** with "INSERT TABLE X ABOUT HERE" placeholders
- **APA 7th edition citations** and reference formatting
- **Times New Roman, double spacing, 1-inch margins**
- **Automatic figure and table numbering**

## 🎯 **Guidelines for Future AI Agents**

### **Repository Guidelines:**
1. **NEVER recreate archived files** - Everything essential is in the main directory
2. **Use the clean script names** - No need to rename or reorganize further
3. **Follow the README.md workflow** - It's designed for new users
4. **Respect the archive system** - Don't move files back without good reason
5. **Maintain APA formatting** - Always use `--to apaquarto-docx`

### **Colleague Support Focus:**
1. **Help with Quarto/R setup** - Package installation, environment setup
2. **Manuscript editing assistance** - Citations, formatting, content updates
3. **Analysis reproduction** - Running scripts, troubleshooting data issues
4. **Visualization enhancements** - Modifying figures for publication
5. **Documentation updates** - Keeping README and methods current

### **DON'T Recreate or Reorganize:**
- ❌ Don't create new preprocessing scripts
- ❌ Don't reorganize the folder structure
- ❌ Don't move files from archive back to main
- ❌ Don't rename the clean scripts
- ❌ Don't duplicate existing functionality
