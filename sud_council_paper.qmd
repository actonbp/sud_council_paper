  The demand for Substance Use Disorder (SUD) counselors is rapidly growing, yet significant challenges remain in expanding the workforce to meet this need. Despite substantial investment in recruitment, heterogeneity in student interest hinders pipeline development. To effectively attract and retain future SUD counselors, a deeper understanding of the factors influencing career interest is crucial. This paper presents findings from a two-part, mixed-methods study investigating student interest in SUD counseling. Study 1 employed a survey administered to students at a major state university (N=?) and utilized Random Forest analysis, an advanced machine learning technique, to identify the most salient predictors of interest in pursuing SUD counseling. Study 2 involved qualitative interviews (N=?) exploring students' perceived barriers, facilitators, and general interest related to SUD and mental health counseling careers. Findings reveal key predictive factors from the quantitative analysis and rich thematic insights from the qualitative data regarding student perspectives. Together, these studies provide critical insights into the complex landscape of student interest in SUD counseling, offering actionable recommendations for targeted workforce development strategies aimed at expanding this vital field.

# Introduction

The field of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) counseling represents a critical component of the behavioral health workforce, addressing a significant public health challenge. National trends indicate a growing demand for qualified SUD counselors, driven by increased awareness, policy changes, and the ongoing opioid crisis [@citation_needed_1]. However, expanding the workforce to meet this demand faces considerable hurdles [@citation_needed_2]. Millions are invested annually in recruitment efforts, yet attracting sufficient numbers of students, particularly those with sustained interest, remains difficult. This difficulty may stem partly from a heterogeneity in student interest levels and a lack of clear understanding regarding the specific factors that draw individuals to, or deter them from, pursuing a career in SUD counseling. Addressing this knowledge gap is essential for developing effective strategies to build and sustain the SUD counseling pipeline. This study employs a mixed-methods approach to identify these critical factors, utilizing both quantitative machine learning techniques (Study 1) and qualitative interviews (Study 2) to provide a comprehensive understanding of student perspectives.

# Methods

This study employed a mixed-methods approach involving two main components: a quantitative survey analysis using machine learning and qualitative interviews. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board at Binghamton University.

### Data Processing

The raw survey data, collected via Qualtrics and stored in `data/survey/survey_raw.csv`, underwent several preprocessing steps to prepare it for analysis using Python libraries, primarily `pandas`.

First, initial data cleaning was performed by filtering respondents based on survey completion metrics. Only responses with 100% `Progress`, a `Finished` status of True, and a `CarelessResponderDC` value of 0 (indicating the response time exceeded a predefined threshold, likely 120 seconds) were retained for analysis. This filtering resulted in a sample of N=397 participant responses available for subsequent steps.

Next, variables relevant to the analysis were selected and renamed for clarity based on a predefined inclusion list (`data/survey/initial_analysis_vars_to_include.csv`). Variables excluded at this stage included survey metadata (e.g., `ResponseId`, `RecordedDate`), direct identifiers, free-text responses (e.g., `demo_anythingelse`, `_TEXT` variables), and specific ranking or qualitative follow-up questions not intended for the primary quantitative analysis. Renaming involved converting original survey variable names (e.g., `Duration (in seconds)`, `career_2`) to more programmatic names (e.g., `duration_seconds`, `sud_counselor_interest`).

Selected variables were then recoded based on their intended type for analysis, as specified in the inclusion list. Ordinal and Likert scale variables (e.g., `sud_counselor_interest`, `sud_counselor_familiarity`, `stress_*` variables) were converted from their original text descriptions (e.g., "Slightly interested", "Moderately Stressful") to numerical values representing the scale levels (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), allowing them to be treated as quantitative data where appropriate. For these specific ordinal/Likert variables, responses corresponding to "I prefer not to answer" were recoded as missing data (`NaN`) to preserve the numeric nature of these scales. In contrast, nominal categorical variables (e.g., `gender_identity`, `race`, `current_year`) were retained with their original text values, including "I prefer not to answer" where applicable, as these categories do not have an inherent numerical order. Numerical variables were kept as numbers.

*Handling Sparse Categories:* To address potential model instability and improve interpretability arising from sparse categories in key demographic variables, several categories were grouped prior to imputation and encoding [@citation_needed_for_grouping]. For `race`, the categories 'Black' (n=12 in training set), 'Other (please specify):' (n=11), 'Middle Eastern' (n=5), and 'I prefer not to answer' (n=2) were combined into a single group labeled 'Other/Multiple/Unknown Race'. For `gender_identity`, the categories 'I prefer not to answer' (n=3), 'Nonbinary' (n=2), 'Gender queer' (n=1), 'Transgender' (n=1), and 'Agender' (n=1) were combined into a single group labeled 'Gender Diverse/Unknown'. This grouping step was applied before imputation and one-hot encoding.

Mising values within these predictors were imputed using the median for numeric/ordinal features and the mode for nominal categorical features (after the grouping step described above). Following imputation, the nominal categorical features were converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding, resulting in a final feature set of 99 predictor variables. Validation checks confirmed the absence of missing values and the appropriate numeric data types in the final feature set.

The resulting processed dataset, containing 38 variables for N=397 participants, was saved as `data/survey/analysis_ready_data.csv`. This dataset formed the basis for subsequent descriptive statistics and was the starting point for further processing specific to the machine learning analysis pipeline.

### Study 1: Quantitative Survey and Machine Learning Analysis

**Participants.** Participants were recruited from the undergraduate student population at Binghamton University through the SONA Systems research participation pool. After the initial data processing described above (N=397), participants with missing data on the primary outcome variable (`sud_counselor_interest` recoded as `NaN`) were excluded, resulting in a final analytical sample of N=391 for the machine learning analysis. The data was then split into training (80%, N=312) and testing (20%, N=79) sets using stratified sampling based on the dichotomized outcome variable. Within the training set (N=312), the distribution for self-reported race included White (n=174), Asian (n=78), Latino or Hispanic (n=30), Black (n=12), Other (n=11), Middle Eastern (n=5), and 'I prefer not to answer' (n=2). For gender identity, the training set included Woman (n=228), Man (n=76), 'I prefer not to answer' (n=3), Nonbinary (n=2), Gender queer (n=1), Transgender (n=1), and Agender (n=1). The sparsity of several categories within race and gender identity necessitates careful consideration in subsequent modeling steps.

**Measures.** The survey included demographic questions, items assessing interest and familiarity with SUD counseling (original variables `career_1`, `career_2`), perceived barriers and facilitators (`career_5_*`, `career_6_*` - though excluded from ML predictors), knowledge of SUD/MH professionals (`career_3`), interest in MH careers (`mh_1`), and wellbeing indicators (`wellbeing_*`). See Appendix A for detailed variable descriptions based on the processed data.

**Machine Learning Preprocessing.** Further processing was performed using `scikit-learn` to prepare the data specifically for the classification model. The primary dependent variable, `sud_counselor_interest`, was dichotomized into a binary variable `interest_dv`. Responses indicating any level of interest ("Slightly interested," "Moderately interested," or "Definitely interested") were coded as 1, while responses indicating "Not interested" were coded as 0. The resulting distribution was 62.5% (n=244) in the "Not interested" class (0) and 37.5% (n=147) in the "Any interest" class (1) within the N=391 analytical sample.

Predictor variables included the 34 selected features from the initial processing step (excluding the target variable and filtering columns like `progress`, `careless_responder`, `completed`). Missing values within these predictors were imputed using the median for numeric/ordinal features and the mode for nominal categorical features. Following imputation, the nominal categorical features were converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding, resulting in a final feature set of 99 predictor variables. Validation checks confirmed the absence of missing values and the appropriate numeric data types in the final feature set.

The fully processed dataset (N=391) was then split into a training set (80%, n=312) and a testing set (20%, n=79). Stratified sampling based on the binary `interest_dv` variable was used to ensure that the proportion of interested versus not-interested participants was approximately equal in both the training and testing sets.

**Machine Learning Analysis.** To identify key predictors of student interest in SUD counseling, a Random Forest classification model was employed using the `scikit-learn` library in Python [@citation_needed_1]. Random Forest, an ensemble method based on multiple decision trees, was chosen for its ability to handle high-dimensional data with mixed predictor types (implicitly, before encoding), capture non-linear relationships between predictors and the outcome, and provide robust estimates of feature importance. The model was trained on the preprocessed training set (n=312) to learn patterns distinguishing between students with any interest versus no interest in SUD counseling. 

The performance of the trained model was then evaluated on the independent testing set (n=79). Key performance metrics including overall accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for each class, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) will be reported to assess the model's predictive capability. Additionally, feature importances derived from the trained Random Forest model will be examined to identify the most influential factors associated with expressing interest in pursuing an SUD counseling career.

While several models showed reasonable performance, the **Logistic Regression model utilizing L1-based feature selection** emerged as the preferred choice. L1 regularization (also known as Lasso) was employed because it performs automatic feature selection by adding a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. This process shrinks the coefficients of less important features towards zero, potentially setting some exactly to zero, thus removing them from the model. This approach leads to a more parsimonious model (one with fewer predictors) which is often easier to interpret, a key goal for understanding the drivers of student interest. Applying L1 regularization during the tuning process identified a subset of 18 potentially relevant features (out of the initial 99). A final Logistic Regression model was then trained and tuned using only these 18 selected features. This model achieved the highest test set ROC AUC score (0.821), offered a good balance between precision and recall, and provided greater simplicity compared to more complex models like Random Forest or XGBoost.

(Note: Detailed performance metrics, confusion matrices, and coefficient analyses for all explored models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, the final binary Logistic Regression, and an exploratory Ordinal Logistic Regression, are available in the project's `results/` directory and can be provided as supplementary material.)

Performance of the final feature-selected Logistic Regression model on the test set is detailed below. @fig-confusion-matrix shows the confusion matrix, illustrating the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. @fig-roc-curve presents the ROC curve, visually representing the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate, with an overall AUC of 0.821.

To understand which factors were most influential in the final model, @tbl-coefficients presents the top 15 features ranked by the absolute magnitude of their coefficients. The odds ratio indicates the multiplicative change in the odds of being interested in an SUD counseling career for a one-unit change in the predictor, holding other predictors constant. Odds ratios greater than 1 suggest a positive association, while those less than 1 suggest a negative association.

The factors most strongly influencing student interest are visualized in @fig-feature-importance, with specific coefficients and odds ratios for the top 15 detailed in @tbl-coefficients. Notably, higher familiarity with the SUD counselor profession (`sud_counselor_familiarity`, OR > 1) and identifying as Hispanic/Latino (`race_Hispanic / Latino`) were associated with significantly increased odds of expressing interest. Conversely, factors such as being in the senior year (`current_year_Senior`) or identifying with certain other racial categories (e.g., `race_White`, `race_Asian`) were associated with decreased odds compared to the reference groups used in the encoding. Wellbeing factors, such as stress related to housing stability (`stress_housing_stability`), also appeared among the influential predictors, though their interpretation requires care given the nature of Likert scales. Further investigation, potentially integrating qualitative findings, is needed to fully understand the complex interplay of these demographic, experiential, and wellbeing factors in shaping career interest.

The specific hyperparameters used for this final model were `C=1000`, `class_weight='balanced'`, `penalty='l1'`, and `solver='liblinear'`. The full classification report and details for all models explored are available in the project's `results/` directory.

### Study 2: Qualitative Interviews

**Participants.** A subset of survey respondents who indicated willingness to participate in a follow-up interview were contacted. [Add details on final interview sample size, recruitment criteria, demographics].

**Procedure.** Semi-structured interviews were conducted via Zoom, lasting approximately 30-45 minutes. Interviews explored students' understanding of SUD/MH counseling, perceived barriers and facilitators to entering these fields, and factors influencing their career interests.

**Analysis.** Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis [@citation_needed_2] to identify recurring patterns and themes related to student perspectives on SUD and MH counseling careers.

# Results

To predict student interest in pursuing a career related to substance use disorder (SUD) counseling (`interest_dv`), several machine learning models were developed and evaluated using data collected from the survey. The primary goal was to identify a model with strong predictive performance, measured primarily by the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC), while also considering other metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, particularly for the positive class (students expressing interest).

Models explored included Random Forest (with and without SMOTE oversampling), Logistic Regression (with L1 and L2 regularization), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using cross-validation, and models were evaluated on a held-out test set.

# Discussion

Discuss the implications of your results, integrating findings from both studies. Consider how the qualitative findings might elaborate on or provide context for the quantitative predictors.
